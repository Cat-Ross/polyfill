# Polyfill

> "Provides facilities that are not built into a web browser. It implements technology that a developer expects the browser to provide natively providing a more uniform API landscape." -- Unknown

Goal: You should code using standard JavaScript as normal as you would on any non-IE browser, and this polyfill should fill in the rest for you by magic! :)

## Support Browsers

To keep the polyfill as small as possible, we're only supporting from IE8 and upward.

## Usage

### As JS (via a CDN)

http://web-toolkit.global.sky.com/components/polyfill/0.0.7/polyfill.js

## As a JS component locally

`bower install --save-dev bskyb-polyfill`

then include `bower_components/bskyb-polyfill/dist/js/polyfill.js` in your project's build/deploy script.

## Contribution

Web components depends on collaboration between developers across Sky. Contributions of any size are actively encouraged.
